Feature: Paginating tickets
  In order to ease the load on the server
  As the system
  I want paginate ticket results

  Background:
    Given there is a project called "Internet Explorer"
    Given there are the following users:
      | email             | password |
      | user@ticketee.com | password |
    And "user@ticketee.com" can view the "Internet Explorer" project
    And I am signed in as them
    And there are 100 tickets for this project

    When I am on the homepage
    And I follow "Internet Explorer"
 
 Scenario: Viewing the second page
   Then I should see 2 pages of pagination
   When I follow "Next" within ".pagination .next"
   Then I see page 2 of tickets for this project
